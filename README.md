# Gated CNN for S&P 500 Prediction

## How it works

This work is inspired by the paper [Gated CNN](https://arxiv.org/pdf/1612.08083.pdf) and [CNN stock price prediction](https://github.com/philipxjm/Convolutional-Neural-Stock-Market-Technical-Analyser)

In this work I applied the Gated CNN on S&P500 stock price prediction.
It beats several methods even without hyperparams tuning:
1. Logistic Regression
2. KNN
3. SVM
4. Random Forest

This method using CNN in a similar way as LSTM but with less training
time needed.


# How to run it
Run the main.py program will give you the results. The layers specs is
also listed in the main.py. Please feel free to play with those hyperparams.
